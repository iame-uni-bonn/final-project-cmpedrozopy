## Final Project
Topic: Christ's Shadow: Non-Cognitive Skills and Prosocial Behavior Amongst the Guarani.
Brief Description: This is a project that involves working with an in-person survey. I am working with a professor I used to work with as RA. The survey has already been done and the data is now available. In the project, I plan to clean data, run regressions and create visualizations.
